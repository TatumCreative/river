# River - An exploration of paths over time.

This is a coding exploration inspired by flying over rivers while flying. I was
inspired by the paths that they traveled and left over time.

## Running locally

Make sure node and npm are installed, then clone this repo. From the folder in
terminal first run `npm install` which will install of the dependencies, then
run `npm run dev` to start a local prototyping server. Finally run
`npm run build` to build the final `bundle.js`.
